# Project Description

Petrol Price Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict the future prices of petrol based on historical data. This project utilizes various data processing, analysis, and machine learning techniques to build an accurate prediction model. The prediction model is developed using the Random Forest algorithm, a popular ensemble learning technique.

## Workflow

* **Petrol Price Data Collection:** Historical petrol price data is collected from reliable sources or APIs. The dataset includes features such as date, location, and the corresponding petrol prices.

* **Data Preprocessing:** The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other data inconsistencies. Data cleaning and transformation techniques are applied to ensure the dataset is suitable for building a prediction model.

* **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to understand the distribution of data, trends, and correlations among features.

* **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the machine learning model and evaluate its performance. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to assess its accuracy and generalization.

* **Random Forest Model:** The Random Forest algorithm is chosen for this project due to its ability to handle complex datasets and capture non-linear relationships effectively. Sklearn is used to implement the Random Forest model.

* **Model Evaluation:** The trained Random Forest model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The evaluation results help to measure the model's accuracy and performance.

## Libraries Used

1. **Sklearn:** Scikit-learn is a popular machine-learning library in Python. It provides various tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. In this project, Sklearn is used to implement the Random Forest algorithm and evaluate the model.

2. **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library in Python. It is employed to create visualizations that help in data analysis and better understanding the trends and patterns in the dataset.

3. **Seaborn:** Seaborn is another data visualization library that is built on top of Matplotlib. It is used to create attractive and informative statistical graphics for a more insightful analysis.

4. **Pandas:** Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that facilitates data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation. It is used to handle the dataset and prepare it for the machine learning process.

5. **NumPy:** NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computations in Python. It is used for array operations, mathematical functions, and working with numerical data.

### Project Outcome

The main objective of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately predicting future petrol prices based on historical data. The successful completion of the project will provide valuable insights into the petrol price trends and fluctuations, aiding various stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding fuel-related matters.
